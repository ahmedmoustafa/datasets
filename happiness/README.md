[The World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be.

The 2019 dataset includes the following columns:

| Column | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `country` | Country or Region |
| `category` | UN classification: Developed, Developing, Underdeveloped, and Transiting |
| `score` | A metric measured by asking the sampled people the question: "How would you rate your happiness on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the happiest." |
| `gdp_per_capita` | GDP per capita |
| `social_support` | Social support |
| `healthy_life_expectancy` | Healthy life expectancy |
| `freedom_to_make_life_choices` | Freedom to make life choices |
| `generosity` | Generosity |
| `perceptions_of_corruption` | Perceptions of corruption |


Here are a few questions:

1. What is the distribution of happiness scores across different categories (Underdeveloped, Transitioning, Developing, Developed)?
2. How does GDP per capita correlate with the happiness score?
3. Is there a significant difference in the healthy life expectancy across different categories?
4. What is the relationship between social support and freedom to make life choices?
5. How does the perception of corruption vary across categories?
6. What is the average happiness score for each category, and how does it change when adjusting for perceptions of corruption?
7. Identify the top 5 countries with the highest increase in happiness score when freedom to make life choices is doubled.
8. How does the ratio of GDP per capita to social support influence the happiness score?
9. For countries below the median happiness score, what is the trend of generosity over different levels of GDP per capita?
