# Questions for Analyzing the Obesity Dataset
## Univariate Analysis
- How is gender distributed in the dataset? Use a bar plot to visualize the distribution.
- What are the mean, median, and standard deviation of the age of participants? Use descriptive statistics functions.
- Create a histogram to analyze the distribution of weight in the dataset. Add appropriate bin sizes and titles.
- What is the proportion of each obesity level in the dataset?

## Bivariate Analysis
- Is there a correlation between weight and height? Use a scatter plot to visualize this relationship.
- How does weight distribution differ between genders? Display this using a boxplot.
- Analyze the relationship between physical activity frequency (FAF) and obesity levels using a bar plot.

## Multivariate Analysis
- Create a heatmap to visualize the correlations between all numerical variables in the dataset.
- Perform PCA on the numerical variables. How much variance is explained by the first two principal components?

## Loops and Conditions
- Divide the dataset into age groups (e.g., <20, 20-40, >40). For each group, calculate the average number of main meals (NCP). Use loops and conditions for this analysis.
- Identify individuals whose weight is beyond 1.5 times the interquartile range. Output the count of such outliers.

## Modeling
- Build a linear regression model to predict weight based on height, age, and gender. What is the model's $R^2$ value?
