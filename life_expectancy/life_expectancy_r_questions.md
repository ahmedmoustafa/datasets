# Questions on Life Expectancy Dataset

1. **Explore the Dataset:**
   - Load the dataset and use functions like `head()`, `summary()`, and `str()` to explore the first few rows, summary statistics, and structure of the dataset.
   
2. **Calculate Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Calculate the mean and median of `Life_expectancy` for all countries.

3. **Filter Data and Calculate Average:**
   - Extract and display data for a specific region, say "Asia", and calculate the average `GDP_per_capita` for this region.

4. **Visualize Data Distribution:**
   - Create a basic histogram of `Life_expectancy` to visualize its distribution using the `hist()` function.

5. **Find Specific Data Points:**
   - Identify the row where `Life_expectancy` is minimum and extract the corresponding country.
   - Identify the row where `GDP_per_capita` is maximum and extract the corresponding year.

6. **Create New Variable:**
   - Create a new column `BMI_category` which categorizes countries as either "Underweight", "Normal weight", "Overweight", or "Obese" based on the `BMI` column values.

7. **Analyze Trends:**
   - Plot the trend of `Life_expectancy` over the years for "Egypt" and analyze any visible trends or patterns.
   - Plot the trend of `Life_expectancy` over the years for "Africa" and analyze any visible trends or patterns.

8. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Calculate and interpret the correlation between `Adult_mortality` and `Life_expectancy`.

9. **Explore Multivariate Relationships:**
   - Explore the relationship between `Life_expectancy`, `Schooling`, and `Alcohol_consumption` using appropriate visualizations such as scatter plots.

10. **Sort and Order Data:**
   - Use the `sort()` function to list the countries in ascending/descending order of `Adult_mortality`.
   - Use the `order()` function to list the top 5 countries based on `BMI` and the bottom 5 countries based on `Schooling`.

11. **Find and Display Rank of Japan (2015):**
   - Find and display the rank of Japan based on the `GDP_per_capita` column for the year 2015.

12. **Identify Country with Highest BMI (2000):**
   - Find and display the country with the highest `BMI` for the year 2000.

13. **Calculate Average Alcohol Consumption for Developed Countries (2005):**
   - Find and display the average `Alcohol_consumption` for "Developed" countries for the year 2005.

14. **Find and Display Rank of India (2010):**
   - Find and display the rank of India based on the `Schooling` column for the year 2010.

15. **Analyze Trends:**
   - Plot the trend of `Life_expectancy` over the years for "Africa" and analyze any visible trends or patterns.
